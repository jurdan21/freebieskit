        <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
          Freebieskit.com is a curated platform that helps creators discover and download over 1,000 free design assets including UI kits, mockups, fonts, icons, illustrations, and more all in one place.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
          We started Freebieskit with a simple question:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg px-6 py-4 mb-4 text-base italic border-l-4 border-gray-300">
          “Why does finding good free design assets still feel like a scavenger hunt?”
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
          As designers and developers, we were tired of clicking through outdated blogs, saving scattered Figma links, and digging through noisy marketplaces all just to find something usable and free. So we built the site we wished existed.<br/>
          Freebieskit is a clean, fast, and curated library of high-quality, free design resources gathered from platforms we trust like Figma, Dribbble, Behance, GitHub, and the design community itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">What you&apos;ll find here:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
          All assets are clearly categorized, properly licensed, and ready to use — no login, no spam, no confusion.
        </p>
